# Potato Sender

A bot which sent messages with links to images on the wykop.pl website where was a charity campaign.

At the event, people had to share pictures of potatoes under the #charytatywnapyra tag (ang. #charitypotato). For each sent post you earned 1zł (later 3zł) for equipment for sick kids. The website rules did not prohibit use the programs that do the automatic work for me, so I created one :).

The program uses the "Selenium WebDriver" library which allows to create a bot that uses different browsers like Chrome or Firefox.
